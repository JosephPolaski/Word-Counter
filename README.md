Word Counter
==============
This is a program I built as for the final project in my data structures class. It is a hash map implementation of a concordance. 
This program will read in a text file and store each unique word into a hash map while counting the number of instances for that word. 
The hash map uses chaining via a linked list to avoid collisions. 
For now this is the complete version but I would like to add further functionality to it in the future as time permits.
